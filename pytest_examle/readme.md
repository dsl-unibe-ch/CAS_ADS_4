# Tests

To run the tests, you need to have `pytest` installed.  
It is included in the `requirements.txt`, so you can install it from the root directory:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once installed, simply run:

```bash
pytest
```

Pytest will automatically discover test files following these patterns:

- `test_*.py`
- `*_test.py`
